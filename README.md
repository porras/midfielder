[WIP] Stays at the middle of the field, connecting back to front ends.

## Installing

We recommend using Rubinious or JRuby, as they offer native threads. You can still use MRI, but many of the performance gains will probably be negleted.

## Ideas

* DSL to create scatter/gather operations.
* In-memory circuit breaker.
* Provide adapters to common infrastructure services such as monitoring and caching


## How it works

_TODO_
